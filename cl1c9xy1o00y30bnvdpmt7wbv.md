## What actually is Web Hosting??

What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.

Most hosting companies require that you own your domain in order to host with them. If you do not have a domain, the hosting companies will help you purchase one.


> Here are some features you should be expecting from your hosting provider:


- Email Accounts:	As mentioned earlier, most hosting providers require users to have their own domain name. With a domain name (e.g. www.facebook.com) and email account features provided by your hosting company, you can create domain email accounts (e.g. yourname@facebook.com).


- FTP Access:	The use of FTP lets you upload files from your local computer to your web server. If you build your website using your own HTML files, you can transfer the files from your computer to the web server through FTP, allowing your website to be accessed through the internet.


- WordPress Support:	WordPress is an online website creation tool. It is a powerful blogging and website content management system, which is a convenient way to create and manage website. WordPress powers over 25% of websites on the internet. Most hosting providers will tell you right away if their plans are WordPress-compatible or not. The simple requirements for hosting your WordPress websites include: PHP version 7 or greater; MySQL version 5.6 or greater.


An advantage of using a website builder is that it allows you to simply drag and drop content to create your site, and publish your site to live with a few clicks. No technical experience is required. With the Website.com site builder, you will not need to build your website with coding, and you will not need to transfer files from your desktop computer to the server through FTP.

## **How can my online business benefit from a web hosting service?**
In order to publish your website online, your business website requires a web hosting service. However, a web host gives business owners more than just web hosting services! For example, web hosting firms typically employ in-house technicians to make sure their clients' websites are up and running 24/7. Plus, when website owners are in need of help or troubleshooting (e.g. script debutting, email not able to send/receive, domain name renewal, and more), the web host's in-house support are the go-to people. A professional web hosting service ensures a hassle-free experience for business owners, so they can efficiently focus their time and effort on their businesses.


## **Types of Web Hosting Services**
There are various types of web hosting services available to host your website. Before signing up for web hosting services, it is important to understand what kind of service your website needs, the kind of server you or your business needs, your budget, and what type of services the web host offers.

 
Hosting options available are:


- Website Builders
- Shared Hosting
- Dedicated Hosting
- Collocated Hosting

### Website Builders
Website builder services is a type of hosting service that caters to beginners who need to host a website, but lack the technical skills and knowledge to build one. Website builder services typically provide you with an online browser-based interface to build your website, and also host the website for you without any additional setup.

### Shared Hosting
In a shared hosting environment, your and other website owners shared one server. This includes sharing the physical server and the software applications within the server. Shared hosting services are affordable because the cost to operate the server is shared between you and these other owners. There are, however, a number of down sides, such as being slower.

### Dedicated Hosting
In a dedicated hosting environment, you have the entire web server to yourself. This allows for faster performance, as you have all the server’s resources entirely, without sharing with other website owners. However, this also means that you will be responsible for the cost of server operation entirely. This is a good choice for websites that requires a lot of system resources, or need a higher level of security.

### Collocated Hosting
In this type of hosting, you will purchase your own server and have it housed at a web host’s facilities. You will be responsible for the server itself. An advantage of this type of hosting service is you have full control of the web server. You can install any scripts or applications you need.


## What is ASP Web Hosting?
ASP web hosting refers to web hosting companies who provide support for ASP, or Active Server Page.

### What is ASP?
ASP/Active Server Pages are HTML pages with embedded ASP scripts. ASP scripts are processed on the server before the page is sent to the visitor's browser. ASP allows you to create dynamic database driven pages, a visitor can access data in a database and interact with page objects such as Active X or Java components.

### How does ASP work?
When you type in a URL in the Address Box of your browser, you are asking the web server to send the file to your computer. If the file is standard HTML, then the file that your web browser receives will look exactly the same as it did on the web server. However, if an ASP file is sent to your computer from the server, it first runs the HTML code, then the ASP code. The ASP code could be anything such as the current time, date, or other such information.

### How to find an ASP web host?
You will need to find a web host who will host your website on a Windows server. It is safer to host your ASP pages on a Windows server as they are more stable and most ASP components work specific to Windows. You also need to consider if your website uses a database, such as SQL and Access. Make sure your web host provides support for the type of database your website requires.


### Domain Name Server (DNS)
Each computer on the Internet is assigned a unique address, called an IP address. A typical IP address looks like this: 199.123.456.7

It is very difficult to keep in mind the IP addresses of all the websites we visit daily. Words are easier to remember than strings of numbers. This is where domain names come into the picture. When you visit a website, all you need to know is its URL. Computers remember numbers, and DNS helps us convert the URL into an IP address that the computer can understand.

When you type in domain.com into your browser, the browser first needs to get the IP address of www.domain.com. The browser contacts a DNS server to query the location of the server where the webpages are stored. Think of it as a directory service of IP address.

The classic phonebook directory analogy, you need to find the company "Joe's Bookstore", you look in the directory and see that it is located on 123 Main Street. Then you go to the address to visit the store.


### Which Web Server - Linux or Windows?
The truth of the matter is these two web server platforms are functionally equivalent, it all depends on what are your hosting needs, and what are you most comfortable with.

Both platforms differ in cost, ease of use, versatility and stability. Windows costs more than Linux.

Linux =) Allows for running scripts written in PHP, Perl, Python and other 
 Unix-originated languages. It usually supports MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

Windows	 =) Allows for running ASP scripts and utilizing .NET and other Microsoft technologies. It supports Microsoft SQL Server and Access database.

If your website does not require any scripting support, you should choose Linux hosting because they are more economical. However, if your website needs scripting and database support, you should choose the platform that supports the technologies you use.


### Features of a Hosting Plan
The basic features of a hosting plan include:

### Disk Space
All hosting accounts offer a certain amount of disk space that you can use to store your web files. It is recommended that you have some sort of estimates on what you need for various tasks. How much space will you need for your emails, web files, databases, etc. By breaking down your usage, you can better estimate how much space you should go for.

### Email Accounts
Email accounts are a common feature of hosting, especially if you are hosting a domain. There are three main types of email accounts: POP3, forwarding, and aliases.


- POP3 accounts are the traditional inboxes. You have space on the server to store your emails, and at the same time, you can use an email program to download your mail. Each login and password combination usually equates to one account.

- Forwarding mail accounts are useful if you are employing the service of another company to filter your emails for you. Rather than storing your emails on your mail server, emails are redirected to another email address.

- Aliases accounts are similar to forwarding mail accounts. Some hosts allow you to setup a catch-all alias, which is often used to collect emails sent to addresses not recognized by your mail server.

#### FTP Access
After you have created your web pages on your computer, you need to transfer those files to your web server. The files are transferred to the server by use of FTP.

####Can I host my website on my personal computer?
Yes, you can. But before you do so, there are limitations you need to take into consideration:

- You should know how to setup a WWW server software on your computer. This is a software that allows Internet users to access the web files on your computer.

- Your Internet service provider supports you running websites on your home computer. You will need to investigate your bandwidth quota.

- Your computer has to stay on at all times. Each time you turn it off or reboot, your website will become unavailable.

- Your website will load slowly as home internet connections are not designed for serving web pages.
